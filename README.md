# npm-typescript-consumer
Example TypeScript application consuming [@jlam55555-playground/npm-typescript][1]

See [@jlam55555-playground/npm-hello-world-consumer][2] for a basic example of how to import and use a package published on the GitHub package registry. The only advancement on this project is that we use TypeScript and a nested entrypoint structure, which are apparent from the [@jlam55555-playground/npm-typescript][1] file structure.
